# `@wpmedia/simple-list-block`
_Fusion News Theme Simple List block is a dynamically-sized list with items of a title and image. The list itself also has a title._

## Acceptance Criteria

- As a Themes customer, I can place a Simple List Block on my PageBuilder pages and templates, so that I can showcase most read or editor's picks content to my readers.

## Props

| **Prop**                  | **Required** | **Type** | **Description**                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **required prop**         | yes          |          |                                                     |
| **optional prop**         | no           |          |                                                     |
| **contentConfig example** |              |          | Please specify which content sources are compatible |

- PageBuilder users can enter an optional Title.
- Can be populated by a feed of content items
- Number of stories is configurable on each use of the feature.

### Similar Blocks

#### `numbered-list`

It is more simple than because it does not have numbers. Otherwise, it's very close to `numbered-list` because of sizing and proportions. Another difference is that `numbered-list` has images on the right, whereas `simple-list` is on the left.

#### `simple-result-list`

It's somewhat similar to `simple-result-list`, taking in stories in a vertical list. However, `simple-list` does not show author.

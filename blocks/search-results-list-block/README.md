## Additional Considerations

_This block expects the user to configure its content source to the search api. The initial query and page are irrelevant as these fields will be overridden by the input text from the search bar._

_It also makes use of ByLine to display authors of each story and it is included as a dependency. The behavior for the byline is as follows:_

- If there's one author, it will return `By <author>`
- If there are two authors, it will return `By <author_0> and <author_1>`
- If there are three or more authors, it will return with the pattern `By <author_0>, <author_1>, ... <author_(n-1)> and <author_(n)>`

### Custom Search Action

If you are creating custom blocks that are leveraging the global content part of the Search Results List block and need to over-ride the action taken when the search box field has been submitted
(for both click and keyboard submissions) an over-ride function can be passed as a prop to either the main default.jsx or to the global-content.jsx component. The prop name is called `customSearchAction`.

If passed into default.jsx it will pass it down to global-content. Your implementation of `customSearchAction` should expect one param that will be the value of the search entry. If `customSearchAction` is not implemented, default behavior will occur during a search submission.

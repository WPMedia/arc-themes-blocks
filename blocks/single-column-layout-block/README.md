# @wpmedia/single-column-layout-block

Basic single column layout with a standard confined width of 90rem(1440px) that has three Page Builder sections (navigation, main, and footer.)

## Acceptance Criteria

- When I create a new page in Page Builder Editor, I see a layout named “Single Column - Regular Width” nested within the Layout field drop down that lives under the Setup view.

- When I select the “Single Column - Regular Width” layout, I see a notification that says: “Successfully updated the Shared Draft with your changes.”

- Once the “Single Column - Regular Width” layout is updated, I can begin to add blocks under the Curate view which shows the following Sections:

  - navigation (should behave the same as existing Right Rail layouts)

  - main (should have a maximum width of 1440 px)

  - footer (should behave the same as existing Right Rail layouts)

- If I want to, I can deselect the “Single Column - Regular Width” layout block and when I do I see a notification that says: “Successfully updated the Shared Draft with your changes.”

- The “Single Column - Regular Width” layout block has a maximum width of 1440 px.

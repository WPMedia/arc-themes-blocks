# Theme Blocks

Itâ€™s a collection of React components designed to:

- Speed up design and development velocity
- Help create consistent and usable functionality in our various websites
- Promote best practices for accessibility and responsive web design

We hope to accomplish these goals by:

- Reducing the number of decisions needed when iterating on UI
- Reducing the amount of code duplication in our apps
- Providing easy-to-use and extensible components for anyone to consume

## Install

Add theme block to your project.

`npm install --save @wpmedia/share-bar-block`

Add to your `blocks.json`.

`@wpmedia/share-bar-block`

### **Use**

Import components you want into your project

`import { ShareBar } from '@wpmedia/share-bar-block';`

and use them like so

```

const data = () => ({
  customFields: {
    email: false,
    facebook: true,
    pinterest: false,
    twitter: false,
    linkedIn: false,
  },
  globalContent: {
    label: {

# @wpmedia/hero-block

The @wpmedia/hero-block provides a large background visual that is used behind a minimal textual and call-to-action
context to give a strong emotional and aesthetic feel to the whole page/content. The textual context includes a
headline, sub-headline and paragraph. The call-to-action context provides actions for the user to take.
The image selected should hold the whole emotional and aesthetic feel concept together, while the textual and call-to-action
contexts should provide the clarity to the message that is being conveyed.

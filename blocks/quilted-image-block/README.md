# @wpmedia/quilted-image-block

The Quilted Image block is a collection of three images, each with a text and button overlay. In a mobile viewport all three images will display above one another. On a larger viewport, the top or bottom image will become full width with the other two images stacked horizontally adjacent to it.

Note: The block will only render an item if there's an overlay, image url, action url, and button text.

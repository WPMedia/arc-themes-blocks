# Theme Blocks

It’s a collection of React components designed to:

- Speed up design and development velocity
- Help create consistent and usable functionality in our various websites
- Promote best practices for accessibility and responsive web design

We hope to accomplish these goals by:

- Reducing the number of decisions needed when iterating on UI
- Reducing the amount of code duplication in our apps
- Providing easy-to-use and extensible components for anyone to consume

## Install

Add theme block to your project.

`npm install --save @wpmedia/share-bar-block`

Add to your `blocks.json`.

`@wpmedia/share-bar-block`

### **Use**

Import components you want into your project

`import { ShareBar } from '@wpmedia/share-bar-block';`

const CustomShareBarBlock = () => (
	<ShareBar

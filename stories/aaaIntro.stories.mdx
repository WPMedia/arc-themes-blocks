# Theme Blocks

Itâ€™s a collection of React components designed to:

- Speed up design and development velocity
- Help create consistent and usable functionality in our various websites
- Promote best practices for accessibility and responsive web design

We hope to accomplish these goals by:

- Reducing the number of decisions needed when iterating on UI
- Reducing the amount of code duplication in our apps
- Providing easy-to-use and extensible components for anyone to consume

## Install

`npm install --save @wpmedia/share-bar-block`
